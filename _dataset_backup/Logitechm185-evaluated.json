Great for a back-up or take it on the road. Just don't drop it. You'll be picking up pieces for weeks. By the way, the exciting news is that it worked... right out of the mailing envelope. So if have a unifying keyboard and the receiver, you can't go wrong. Heck, buy a half a dozen for under $30 and toss 'em when the battery dies.

It's lightweight and maneuverable in a way that my older \"brick-size\" mice were not. The unobtrusive USB receiver is super compact. And I like the fact that there is an on-off switch which should help with battery life. It's also handy, when I put the desktop to sleep, to turn the mouse off so if it's inadvertently bumped, it won't wake up the computer which used to happen a lot with my older, always-on, \"brick\". I've paid three different prices for the three units I've bought here on eBay -- $6, $14 & $8 -- all with shipping included, and at any of those pricesthey were a \"deal\". Great product!",

I had a slight panic as I thought the USB dongle wasn't there, then realised it was stored inside the battery compartment. Actually a good design feature.I was also concerned that it may use the dongle of my old mouse but it seems to have its' own frequency so there is no interference.

Although at present its sometimes necessary to click twice when once should be enough, this may be due to settings on the computer that need to be changed rather than being a fault with the mouse.

We have all heard of the expression 'buy cheap, buy twice', well I did it three times before realising that it takes a well known brand-name to get a decent mouse.This mouse is by no means, a high-end, gaming mouse, but it is simple, ergonomic, comfortable and does the job well on numerous surface types. It has an on/off button, but I must confess I never use it as the battery seems to go on and on for months.Although it only has three buttons, Logitech software can been downloaded to enable you to make the scroll wheel into a 'back' button if you wish or in fact assign any other combinations such as make it left-handed. The software also warns you when the mouse battery is low.Having bought three unbranded mice from China over a period of a year, that fell apart, didn't work on wooden tables, or broke within 2 months, I thought it was time to spend a little more and purchase one with a name I knew. Actually, I liked it so much....I bought another for a friend.",

Which, when you are busy is a bit annoying, I will persevere for a while longer but may have to replace it to avoid the frustration.",
