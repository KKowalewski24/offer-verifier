This is not a mechanical keyboard by any stretch, but it still feels responsive enough for everyday use and light gaming. This is the third one I've bought for other computers.

The original Dell u473dhas an aluminum chassis which made it very sturdy and great for work, play and typing because it simply didn't move being so heavy. I guess all good things come to an end and Dell moved on to cheaper plastic materials which you can now see in this KB522. It is a great keyboard with media key controls and feels a lot better than most other OEM manufacturers but the weight and action do not fair well in comparison to the u473d.I still highly recommend Dell's multimedia keyboards from this series, they are top notch and there's a reason why the price tag for used is relatively high.",

I find the scroll wheel volume control better than -/+ buttons, and it provides you plenty of other of multimedia buttons like just about every keyboard does these days. I was shopping for a cheap keyboard for use with a secondary PC that was also comfortable, low-profile and provided wrist support. This Dell keyboard fits the bill perfectly and I'm considering getting another as a backup for use with test systems.",

That's about my only criticism - I wish the keyboard sat at a greater incline with the feet deployed, but that's a small gripe for what is otherwise a very good piece of kit.",

It has two USB pass-thru ports; no good for charging but fine for hooking up a wired mouse and things of that nature.Even though it has a full extended UK layout - including special keys for common functions such as calculator, mute and a rotating volume control - it has a surprisingly modest desktop footprint which I certainly appreciate.Equally modest are the keyboard's feet; they provide a good firm platform during use but barely change the angle from flat. That's about my only criticism - I wish the keyboard sat at a greater incline with the feet deployed, but that's a small gripe for what is otherwise a very good piece of kit.",
